            <br>What could possibly go wrong? 
            <br>Bob is a sponge that lives in an underwater city known as bikini bottom. 
            He always wears square pants because of his square body. Accompanied by his snail and many friends, SpongeBob leads a happy life working in the Krusty Crab on a daily basis as the chef. His cooking skills are remarkable amongst the sea creatures from all over the ocean. <br>SpongeBob sometimes encounters difficulties or problems (mostly because of Squidward)<br>but he is always able to fight through <br>and spread positivity like the <br>heroic sponge he is.</p>
